                <span class="text_hl">Cap Rocat</span> is much more than a hotel: it is an architectural and environmental conservation project,
                as well as a tribute to all travellers who understand that visiting a new place contributes towards
                creating a legacy of love and respect for other cultures and ways of life. This legacy is the essence
                of the Vignetti-Obrador photo collection, which is preserved and can be visited at the Cap Rocat museum.
                Enjoying travel as the vital experience it is — unhurriedly — and with the aim of growing spiritually is
                the essence and philosophy of Cap Rocat. A journey for the senses that lets us reconnect with love for our
                own through the unknown.
